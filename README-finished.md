## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learnt a lot by doing this challenge. One of the problems that I had to solve is to create borders only at the four corners of a list element. I solved this by using the ::before and ::after pseudo elements. I gave them a transparent background color so they wouldn't obstruct the real content, also the borders of them is white so that only the corner borders revealed.

I also learned that border is drawn toward the inside of an element, not like margin.
I used the linear-gradient tool to make the background look more interesting instead of just using a single color.

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about using gradient, calc() function, svg and path tags.
